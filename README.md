# Context
This was the project requested as part of the object-oriented-programming exam during my first year of University. It is here for archival purposes.

Notes: believe it or not, most of the work is made by myself since my colleagues didn't contribute much. I managed to create the graphics console for this game in 3/4 days of coding, and the idea of implementing it was already in my mind a bunch of weeks before the implementation.

I sincerely hope I'll have to work with better programmers in the future.

Also, I learned a bit about git while coding, and this was really useful about managing the code and checking the changes made by the others (or even myself) in the past.
